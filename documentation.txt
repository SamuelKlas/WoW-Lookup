The goal of this project was to learn the basics of React when writing web applications, and to
use data from a foreign API, in this case the Blizzard WoW Profile API.

The function of the site is to look up max level World of Warcraft characters and see relevant
information about them.
A character is identified by their name, the server they are populating, and the region the server
is based in. Some characters
that can be used for seeing the functionality are :
Region - Server - Name
eu - Drak'Thul - Adaldo
eu - Drak'Thul - Moosebreeder
eu - Drak'Thul - Bifteck
us - Illidan - Tagzz
us - Bleeding Hollow - Terza
eu - Burning Legion - Alexblast
eu - Drak'Thul - Payned
eu - Outland - Trillethree

The app is made up of a form component and a character component. The character consists of several
components/sections, each of which offers information about a specific type of data, like the character's
equipment or player vs player records.
